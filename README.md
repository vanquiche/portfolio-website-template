## Motivation

As much as I love websites with bold designs, flashy transitions and scrolling animations, In my opinion, a portfolio website may not be the place for it (Iâ€™ve added some animation to make this site dynamic without being distracting). What I've come to learn is that most people have short attention spans. Youâ€™ll risk users skipping your content if your website is confusing or annoying to use. Some things that typically result in a bad user experience (aside from long load times, poor color schemes, and unintuitive navigation/layout) are:

- Scroll hijacking (for more info, click [here](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/what-is-scroll-hijacking/))
- Slow animation/transitions (anything over 1000ms)
- Distracting animated backgrounds

This project was bootstrap with Next.js. Next provides some great features out of the box that in my opinion, provides some of the best user and developer experience. Here are some of the features that I love:

- **SEO-friendly**: Rich HTML with SSR
- **Performance Optimization**: Images are lazy loaded, cached, and many other optimizing features!
- **Easy Deploy**: If you choose to host with Vercel, there is no easier and faster way to get your site live

## Accessibility

Last but not least, I coded this project with accessibility in mind, but I'm by no means an expert. If you use this template for your own project, I encourage you to continue to improve the accessibility where it is applicable.
