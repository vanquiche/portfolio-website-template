# Personal Portfolio Template
- add example images
- add live site

I created this for my own personal portfolio website. If you like what you see, you’re welcome to use this project as a template for your own website. This project was bootstrap with Next.js. Next provides some great features out of the box that in my opinion, provides some of the best user and developer experience. Here are some of the features that I love:

- **SEO-friendly**: You get rich HTML with SSR
- **Performance Optimization**: Images are lazy loaded, cached, and many other optimizing features!
- **Easy Deploy**: If you choose to host with Vercel, there is no easier and faster way to get your site live

## Design Philosophy

As much as I love websites with bold designs, flashy transitions and scrolling animations, In my opinion, a portfolio website may not be the place for it (I’ve some animation to make this site to be dynamic without being distracting). What I've come to learn is that most people have short attention spans and are lazy. You’ll risk users skipping your content if your website is confusing or annoying to use. Some things that typically result in a bad user experience (aside from long load times, poor color schemes, and unintuitive navigation/layout) are:

- Scroll hijacking (for more info, click [here](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/what-is-scroll-hijacking/))
- Slow animation/transitions (anything over 1000ms)
- Distracting animated backgrounds

You can think of your portfolio website as an advert and the goal of any advert is conversion. In this context, our conversion goal is to convince any potential employer on your site to make contact, which hopefully leads to an interview, and ultimately a job.

## Accessibility

Last but not least, I coded this project with accessibility very much in mind, however, I’m an advocate for accessibility but far from an expert. If you do use this template for your own project, I encourage you to continue to improve the accessibility where it is applicable.
